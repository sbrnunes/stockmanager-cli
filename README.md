This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.11.1.

The building tool used is Grunt, so, it will need to be installed (check the previous link for instructions).

Because it uses SASS with [Compass](http://compass-style.org/), you'll also need to install a Ruby VM and Compass. 
Instructions can be found [here](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass)

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
